== README

A Ruby on Rails training works, Continue to spend five months of weekends.

I learned:

* How to use Ruby on Rails.

* Use some of the Gems: Devise, Paperclip, jQuery-fileupload-rails, Pry, etc.

* Deployment

* How to use jQuery and Ajax on the rails framework.

* ...

This process is difficult but also very interesting, I love design products and coding.

This is my first publish although there are some bug but I will not update this, just as an exercise.
